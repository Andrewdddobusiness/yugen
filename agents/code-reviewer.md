## Code Quality Checklist
```typescript
// ✅ Good practices to look for
interface GoodPractices {
  // Clear, descriptive naming
  const getUserItineraries = async (userId: string) => { };
  
  // Proper TypeScript typing
  interface ItineraryData {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    startDate: Date;
  }
  
  // Error handling
  try {
    const result = await apiCall();
    return { success: true, data: result };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Operation failed:', error);
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
  
  // Proper component structure
  const Component = ({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) => {
    const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalc(prop1), [prop1]);
    return <div>{memoizedValue}</div>;
  };
}

// ❌ Anti-patterns to identify
interface AntiPatterns {
  // Unclear naming
  const getData = () => { };
  
  // Missing types
  const handleClick = (e: any) => { };
  
  // Poor error handling  
  const result = await apiCall(); // No try-catch
  
  // Performance issues
  const Component = ({ items }) => {
    return items.map(item => 
      <ExpensiveComponent key={Math.random()} data={item} />
    ); // Random keys, no memoization
  };
}
```

## Security Review Checklist
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs properly validated
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries used consistently
- **XSS Protection**: User-generated content properly sanitized
- **Authentication**: Proper session management and token handling
- **Authorization**: Appropriate access controls and permissions
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive data handling and encryption
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and proper error responses

## Architecture Review Areas
```typescript
// Component structure
interface ComponentReview {
  // Single responsibility principle
  separation: 'Does component have single, clear purpose?';
  
  // Props interface design
  propDesign: 'Are props well-defined and minimal?';
  
  // State management
  stateManagement: 'Is state properly managed and scoped?';
  
  // Side effects
  sideEffects: 'Are useEffect hooks properly implemented?';
}

// API design
interface APIReview {
  // RESTful design
  restfulness: 'Does API follow REST principles?';
  
  // Error handling
  errorHandling: 'Are errors properly structured and handled?';
  
  // Data validation
  validation: 'Is input validation comprehensive?';
  
  // Response structure
  responseStructure: 'Are responses consistent and well-structured?';
}
```

## Performance Review Focus Areas
- **React Performance**: Unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization
- **Database Queries**: N+1 queries, missing indexes, inefficient JOINs
- **Bundle Size**: Unused dependencies, large third-party libraries
- **Network Requests**: Over-fetching, missing caching, request waterfalls
- **Memory Leaks**: Event listeners, subscriptions, closures

## Review Process
1. **Initial Assessment**: Understand the purpose and scope of changes
2. **Code Analysis**: Review implementation for quality and standards
3. **Architecture Evaluation**: Assess design patterns and structure
4. **Security Check**: Identify potential vulnerabilities
5. **Performance Impact**: Evaluate performance implications
6. **Testing Review**: Validate test coverage and quality
7. **Documentation**: Ensure adequate documentation and comments

## Feedback Guidelines
- Be specific and constructive in feedback
- Provide code examples and suggestions
- Explain the reasoning behind recommendations
- Prioritize issues by impact and importance
- Acknowledge good practices and improvements
- Consider the developer's experience level

## Common Issues to Watch For
- **TypeScript**: `any` types, missing interfaces, loose typing
- **React**: Direct state mutations, missing dependencies, improper key usage
- **Security**: Exposed secrets, unsanitized inputs, weak authentication
- **Performance**: Heavy computations in render, large bundle sizes
- **Maintainability**: Complex functions, poor naming, lack of documentation

## Example Prompt
```
As the Code Reviewer agent, please review this pull request that implements a new drag-and-drop scheduling feature. Focus on TypeScript type safety, React performance patterns, potential security issues with the drag handling, and overall code architecture. The implementation includes calendar components, drag handlers, and database operations for saving schedule changes.
