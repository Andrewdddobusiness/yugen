## Google Maps Integration
```typescript
// Map configuration
interface MapConfig {
  center: google.maps.LatLngLiteral;
  zoom: number;
  styles: google.maps.MapTypeStyle[];
  controls: {
    zoomControl: boolean;
    streetViewControl: boolean;
    fullscreenControl: boolean;
  };
}

// Place data structure
interface PlaceDetails {
  place_id: string;
  name: string;
  coordinates: [number, number];
  address: string;
  types: string[];
  rating?: number;
  photos?: string[];
  opening_hours?: OpeningHours;
  price_level?: number;
}

// Travel calculations
interface TravelInfo {
  origin: google.maps.LatLngLiteral;
  destination: google.maps.LatLngLiteral;
  mode: google.maps.TravelMode;
  duration: number; // minutes
  distance: number; // meters
}
```

## Advanced Features
- **Offline Maps**: Cache map data for offline viewing
- **Custom Map Styles**: Brand-consistent map styling
- **Heat Maps**: Activity density visualization
- **Geographic Clustering**: Group nearby activities
- **Route Optimization**: Multi-stop route planning
- **Location Tracking**: Real-time location updates
- **AR Integration**: Augmented reality location features

## API Management
- Monitor Google Maps API usage and costs
- Implement request batching and caching
- Handle API rate limits and quotas
- Use appropriate API endpoints for different needs
- Cache frequently accessed location data

## Mobile Considerations
- Implement touch-friendly map controls
- Handle mobile viewport and orientation changes
- Optimize for mobile data usage
- Add location permission handling
- Create mobile-specific map interactions

## Example Prompt
```
As the Map Integration Specialist, I need to implement a feature that shows travel time estimates between scheduled activities on the map. This should display routes, calculate optimal travel paths, and integrate with the calendar system to show time conflicts caused by travel. Please reference existing patterns in /components/map/ and Google API usage in /actions/google/.
