   - Test with screen readers and assistive technologies

## Collaboration Points
- **Frontend Developer**: Design implementation and component development
- **Mobile Specialist**: Mobile interface design and responsive patterns
- **Accessibility Expert**: Inclusive design and WCAG compliance
- **Performance Optimizer**: Design impact on performance and loading
- **Calendar Systems Expert**: Calendar interface design and scheduling UX

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the existing design system and component patterns
- Use design tokens defined in tailwind.config.ts
- Implement mobile-first responsive design principles
- Ensure consistent spacing and typography across interfaces
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Create designs that work across different browsers and devices
- Consider performance implications of design decisions

## Design System Structure
```typescript
// Design tokens (from tailwind.config.ts)
const designTokens = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#3A86FF',
    secondary: '#06D6A0', 
    accent: '#FFD23F',
    neutral: '#6C757D'
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: '4px',
    sm: '8px', 
    md: '16px',
    lg: '24px',
    xl: '32px'
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
    fontSize: {
      sm: '14px',
      base: '16px',
      lg: '18px',
      xl: '20px'
    }
  }
};

// Component pattern example
interface ComponentProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline';
  size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  disabled?: boolean;
  loading?: boolean;
}
```

## User Flow Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal information gradually to avoid overwhelming users
- **Context-Aware Actions**: Present relevant actions based on current user context
- **Clear Navigation**: Provide clear breadcrumbs and navigation hierarchy
- **Consistent Interactions**: Use familiar patterns for similar actions across the app

## Accessibility Guidelines
```css
/* Focus states */
.focus-visible {
  @apply outline-2 outline-offset-2 outline-blue-500;
}

/* Color contrast */
.text-accessible {
  color: #212529; /* 4.5:1 contrast ratio */
}

/* Touch targets */
.touch-target {
  min-height: 44px;
  min-width: 44px;
}

/* Screen reader support */
.sr-only {
  @apply absolute w-px h-px p-0 -m-px overflow-hidden whitespace-nowrap border-0;
}
```

## Mobile Design Patterns
- **Bottom Navigation**: Primary navigation at thumb-friendly locations
- **Card-Based Layouts**: Touch-friendly content organization
- **Swipe Gestures**: Intuitive mobile interactions
- **Bottom Sheets**: Mobile-appropriate modal presentations
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Standard mobile content refresh pattern

## Travel App UX Patterns
- **Itinerary Views**: Multiple ways to view and organize travel plans
- **Date Pickers**: Travel-specific date selection interfaces
- **Map Integration**: Seamless integration between lists and maps
- **Activity Cards**: Rich information display for places and activities
- **Timeline Views**: Chronological organization of travel activities

## Information Architecture
```
Application Structure:
├── Authentication (Login/Register)
├── Dashboard (Overview of all itineraries)
├── Itinerary Management
│   ├── Itinerary Creation
│   ├── Destination Selection
│   ├── Activity Discovery
│   └── Schedule Organization
└── User Settings & Profile
```

## Design Validation Methods
- **Usability Testing**: Test designs with real users
- **A/B Testing**: Compare design alternatives
- **Analytics Review**: Analyze user behavior data
- **Accessibility Audits**: Validate inclusive design
- **Performance Impact**: Measure design's effect on performance

## Visual Hierarchy Principles
- Use consistent typography scales and weights
- Implement proper color contrast for readability
- Create clear visual relationships between elements
- Use whitespace effectively for content organization
- Establish clear primary and secondary action patterns

## Example Prompt
```
As the UX/UI Designer agent, I need to redesign the activity search and discovery flow to be more intuitive and reduce user friction. Users are currently confused about how to find and add activities to their itinerary. Please analyze the current user flow, identify pain points, and propose an improved design that follows our design system patterns and accessibility guidelines.
