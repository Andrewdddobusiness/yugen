# FEATURE-001: Improve map integration with itinerary activities

## Priority: Medium
## Status: Open
## Assignee: Unassigned
## Type: Enhancement

## Description
Enhance the existing map integration to provide better visualization of itinerary activities, including route planning, activity markers, and interactive map features that complement the calendar and list views.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Display all scheduled activities as markers on map
- [ ] Show daily routes connecting scheduled activities
- [ ] Add activity clustering for dense areas
- [ ] Implement map synchronization with calendar/list views
- [ ] Create interactive activity markers with details
- [ ] Add route optimization visualization
- [ ] Implement travel time overlays
- [ ] Create map-based activity scheduling
- [ ] Add location-based activity suggestions
- [ ] Implement map export functionality

## Map Features

### Activity Visualization
- **Activity Markers**: Custom markers for different activity types
- **Day-by-Day Routes**: Connect activities by day with different colors
- **Time-Based Animation**: Show daily route progression
- **Activity Clustering**: Group nearby activities to reduce clutter
- **Selected Activity Highlighting**: Highlight selected activities

### Interactive Features
- **Marker Click**: Show activity details popup
- **Route Clicking**: Display travel time and options
- **Map Scheduling**: Drag activities from map to calendar
- **Distance Measurement**: Show distances between activities
- **Area Selection**: Select activities within drawn area

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Map Components
- `components/map/ItineraryMap.tsx` - Main map with activities
- `components/map/ActivityMarker.tsx` - Custom activity markers
- `components/map/RouteVisualization.tsx` - Daily route display
- `components/map/MapActivityPopover.tsx` - Activity detail popups
- `components/map/TravelTimeOverlay.tsx` - Travel time visualization

### Map State Integration
```typescript
interface MapState {
  activities: ScheduledActivity[];
  selectedActivities: string[];
  visibleDays: string[];
  showRoutes: boolean;
  mapCenter: Coordinates;
  zoomLevel: number;
  activeDay: string | null;
}
```

## Dependencies
- Existing map components in `components/map/`
- Calendar and list view states
- Google Maps API
- Route optimization algorithms

## Estimated Effort
5-6 hours

## Notes
- Build upon existing map infrastructure
- Focus on integration with scheduling views
- Consider performance with many activities
