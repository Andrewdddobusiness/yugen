#### 7. LocationSuggestions.tsx
- **Contextual activity suggestions** based on existing activities
- **Smart filtering system** by activity type, rating, price, and availability
- **Interactive suggestion markers** with purple sparkle design
- **Detailed suggestion info windows** with ratings and recommendations
- **Activity type compatibility analysis** for complementary suggestions
- **Real-time suggestion updates** based on map center and existing activities
- **Integration with itinerary** for easy activity addition

#### 8. MapExport.tsx

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Map Components
- `components/map/ItineraryMap.tsx` - Main map with activities
- `components/map/ActivityMarker.tsx` - Custom activity markers
- `components/map/RouteVisualization.tsx` - Daily route display
- `components/map/MapActivityPopover.tsx` - Activity detail popups
- `components/map/TravelTimeOverlay.tsx` - Travel time visualization

### Map State Integration
```typescript
interface MapState {
  activities: ScheduledActivity[];
  selectedActivities: string[];
  visibleDays: string[];
  showRoutes: boolean;
  mapCenter: Coordinates;
  zoomLevel: number;
  activeDay: string | null;
}
```

## Dependencies

- Calendar and list view states
- Google Maps API
- Route optimization algorithms

## Estimated Effort
5-6 hours

## Notes
