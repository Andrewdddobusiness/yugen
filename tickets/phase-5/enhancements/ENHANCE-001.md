# ENHANCE-001: Optimize Activity Fetch Performance

## Priority: Medium
## Status: Pending
## Assignee: Unassigned
## Type: Performance Enhancement

## Description
The POST `/itinerary/{itineraryId}/{destinationId}/activities` endpoint is currently taking 69ms to fetch activities, which is too slow for optimal user experience. This needs to be optimized to improve the responsiveness of the activities search functionality.

## Performance Issue Details
- **Current Response Time**: 69ms average
- **Target Response Time**: <20ms
- **Endpoint**: `POST /itinerary/{itineraryId}/{destinationId}/activities`
- **Issue Impact**: Slow loading of activities in the wide search functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reduce activity fetch response time from 69ms to under 20ms
- [ ] Implement database query optimization for activity searches
- [ ] Add proper indexing for frequently accessed columns
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for repeated searches
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and logging
- [ ] Ensure pagination works efficiently with optimized queries
- [ ] Maintain data accuracy while improving performance

## Technical Implementation

### Database Optimizations
- Analyze and optimize database queries used in activity fetching
- Add proper indexes on frequently searched columns (city_id, place_id, coordinates)
- Implement query result caching at database level
- Review and optimize JOIN operations in activity queries

### Caching Strategy
- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed activity data
- Cache search results based on location and search parameters
- Set appropriate cache TTL values for different data types
- Implement cache invalidation strategy for updated activities

### Query Optimization
- Review current SQL queries for N+1 problems
- Implement proper pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET optimization
- Use database-level filtering instead of application-level filtering
- Optimize coordinate-based spatial queries

### Monitoring & Logging
- Add performance monitoring for activity fetch endpoints
- Implement query execution time logging
- Set up alerts for response times exceeding thresholds
- Add database performance metrics tracking

## Dependencies
- Database performance analysis tools
- Redis setup for caching (if not already available)
- Performance monitoring infrastructure

## Estimated Effort
4-5 hours

## Notes
- This optimization was identified during the resolution of excessive POST requests in wide search
- Focus should be on database query optimization first, then caching
- Ensure backwards compatibility with existing API contracts
- Consider implementing this as part of a broader database performance review
