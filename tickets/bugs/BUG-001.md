# BUG-001: Fix any existing TypeScript errors and warnings

## Priority: Medium
## Status: Open
## Assignee: Unassigned
## Type: Bug Fix

## Description
Audit and fix all existing TypeScript errors, warnings, and type inconsistencies throughout the codebase to ensure type safety and improve development experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Run TypeScript compiler and identify all errors/warnings
- [ ] Fix type errors in existing components
- [ ] Add proper type definitions for missing types
- [ ] Update import/export statements for type safety
- [ ] Fix any `any` types with proper type definitions
- [ ] Ensure strict TypeScript compliance
- [ ] Add missing prop types for React components
- [ ] Fix async/await type issues
- [ ] Update deprecated type usage
- [ ] Verify all external library types are properly imported

## Common Issues to Address
- Missing prop types in React components
- Incorrect type imports vs value imports
- `any` types that should be properly typed
- Missing return types on functions
- Incorrect async/await typing
- Import/export type inconsistencies

## Technical Tasks
1. Run `npm run build` and collect all TypeScript errors
2. Run `npm run lint` to identify linting issues
3. Systematically fix each error by file/component
4. Add proper type definitions where missing
5. Update tsconfig.json if needed for stricter checking

## Files Likely to Need Updates
- Components in `components/` directory
- Server actions in `actions/` directory
- Store definitions in `store/` directory
- Utility functions in `utils/` directory
- Type definitions and schemas

## Dependencies
- None (prerequisite for other development)

## Estimated Effort
3-4 hours

## Notes
- This should be completed early to ensure clean development
- Consider enabling stricter TypeScript rules
- Document any type decisions made
- May reveal underlying architectural issues
