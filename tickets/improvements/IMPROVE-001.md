# IMPROVE-001: Refactor component structure for better maintainability

## Priority: Medium
## Status: Open
## Assignee: Unassigned
## Type: Improvement

## Description
Refactor the existing component structure to improve organization, reusability, and maintainability. Focus on creating consistent patterns, reducing code duplication, and establishing clear component hierarchies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit existing component structure and identify issues
- [ ] Create consistent component naming conventions
- [ ] Establish component hierarchy and organization patterns
- [ ] Extract reusable components and hooks
- [ ] Reduce code duplication across similar components
- [ ] Implement consistent prop interfaces
- [ ] Add comprehensive component documentation
- [ ] Create component composition patterns
- [ ] Establish consistent styling approaches
- [ ] Update imports and exports for new structure

## Refactoring Areas

### Component Organization
- Group related components in logical directories
- Separate business logic from presentation components
- Create shared/common component library
- Establish consistent file naming patterns

### Code Reuse
- Extract common functionality into custom hooks
- Create reusable UI components
- Implement component composition patterns
- Share common interfaces and types

### Structure Improvements
```
components/
├── ui/           # Basic UI components (existing)
├── common/       # Shared business components
├── features/     # Feature-specific components
│   ├── calendar/
│   ├── wishlist/
│   ├── activities/
│   └── maps/
├── layouts/      # Layout components
└── providers/    # Context providers
```

## Technical Tasks
1. Analyze current component dependencies and usage
2. Identify duplicated code and logic
3. Create component refactoring plan
4. Implement new component structure incrementally
5. Update all imports and exports
6. Test component functionality after refactoring
7. Update documentation and examples

## Benefits
- Improved code maintainability
- Easier component discovery and reuse
- Reduced bundle size through better tree-shaking
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Easier testing and debugging

## Dependencies
- BUG-001 (TypeScript fixes) should be completed first
- May impact ongoing development work

## Estimated Effort
6-8 hours

## Notes
- Plan refactoring in phases to minimize disruption
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Consider creating component documentation/storybook
- Test thoroughly after each refactoring phase
